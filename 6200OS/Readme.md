# Multithreading

## Foreword

In this project, you will design and implement a multi-threaded web server that
serves static files based on a GetFile protocol. Alongside the server, you will
also create a multi-threaded client that acts as a load generator for the
server. Both the server and client will be written in C and be based on a
sound, scalable design.

## Setup

Please follow the instructions given in the [environment](https://github.gatech.edu/gios-fall19/environment)
repository for setting up your development/test environment.

You can clone the code in this repository with the command

```console
$ git clone https://github.gatech.edu/gios-fall19/pr1.git
```

We **strongly** recommend that you disable pushes to the class repository: if you do
so, your changes will become visible to everyone in the class.  If you then try to
*clean it up* you will make it impossible for us to do so.  To prevent this, please
type the following **from the pr1 directory** after you have cloned the repository:

```console
$ git remote set-url --push origin DO_NOT_PUSH
```

This will protect you from being able to push to the class repository.  Note that we no longer
allow forks, to prevent erroneous pull requests (which are visible to everyone).

## Submission Instructions

All code should be submitted using the submit.py script given at the top
level of this repository.  For instructions on how to submit individual
components of the assignment see the instructions below.  You may submit as
many times as you like.  Your last submission before the project deadline will
be downloaded by the teaching assistants and graded according to the assignment
rubric.

Note: because Georgia Tech now requires two factor authentication you will need
to obtain a special token for submitting your code.  See [https://bonnie.udacity.com/auth_tokens/two_factor](https://bonnie.udacity.com/auth_tokens/two_factor)
for information on how to obtain and store this token.  Once you have done so
you will be able to submit for **all** projects in this course.

After submitting, you may double-check the results of your submission by
visiting the [Udacity/GT autograding website](https://bonnie.udacity.com) and
going to the student portal.

Note: under heavy load, you may get a timeout error from Bonnie.  The results
on the web page will show you the estimated completion time.  When the test
run is completed, your results will be updated.

**Do not submit the job multiple times** - this makes it go slower (since there
are now more jobs to process,) not faster.

## README

Throughout the project, we encourage you to keep notes on what you have done,
how you have approached each part of the project and what resources you used in
preparing your work.  We have provided you with a prototype file,
**readme-student.md** that you may use as the basis for this report.

If you prefer, you may generate a **pdf** version of your report and submit it
under the name **readme-student.pdf**.  You may submit either (or both) of
your reports with the command:

```console
$ python submit.py readme
```

The Udacity site will store your submission in a database. This will be used
during grading.  The submit script will acknowledge receipt of your README
file.

* For this assignment, you may submit your code up to 10 times per day.  After
  the deadline,  we download your last submission prior to the
  deadline, review your submission and assign a grade. Your readme file has no
  limit on the number of submissions. *

We strongly encourage you to think about testing your own code.  Test driven
development is a standard technique for softare, including systems software.
Bonnie is a _grader_, not your test suite.

## Warm-up: Sockets

In this project, your client and server will communicate via sockets.  To help
you familiarize yourself with C’s standard socket API, you will complete a few
warm-up exercises

### Echo Client-Server

Most socket tutorials start with a client-server pair where the server simply
echoes (that is, repeats back) the message that  the client sends.  Sometimes
referred to as the EchoClient and the EchoServer.   In the first part of this
assignment, you will turn in a pair of programs that perform these roles.

For this first part of the assignment, we will make some simplifying
assumptions.  You may assume that neither the message to the server nor the
response will be longer than 15 bytes.  Thus, you may statically allocate
memory (e.g. `char buffer[16];`) and then pass this memory address into send or
recv.  Because these messages are so short, you may assume that the full
message is sent or received in every send or recv call.  (If you may like, you
may detect when this is not the case by looking at the return value and simply
exiting if the full message is not sent or received).  Neither your server nor
your client should assume that the string response will be null-terminated,
however.

It is important that the only output (either to stdout or stderr) be the response
from the server.  Any missing or additional output causes the test to fail.

Your echoserver should not terminate after sending its first response; rather,
it should prepare to serve another request.  You may consult the references suggested
in this document or others on the internet.

Once you have completed your programs inside the echo directory, you may submit
it from the main directory with the command

```console
$ python submit.py echo
```

At the prompt, please provide your GT username and password.
The program will then ask you if you want to save the jwt.  Reply, yes to have
a token saved on your filesystem so that you don't have to provide your
username and password each time that you submit.

**Note** If you use GT two factor authentication, the above method with your
password will not work.  Instead, please refer to [https://bonnie.udacity.com/auth_tokens/two_factor](https://bonnie.udacity.com/auth_tokens/two_factor)
for information on how to generate a web token and then save that so you can submit
automatically.

Once submitted, Bonnie will test your echoclient.c code with its own reference
implementation of the echoserver.c and your echoserver.c code with its own
reference implementation of echoclient.c.  It will then return some feedback to
help you refine your code.

 **Note** For this assignment, you may submit your code up to 10 times per day.  After
  the deadline,  we download your last submission prior to the
  deadline, review your submission and assign a grade.

We do this because we encourage you to develop your own tests rather than rely upon Bonnie.

### Transferring a File

Because the network interface is a shared resource, the OS does not guarantee
that calls to `send` will copy the contents of the full range of memory that is
specified to the socket.  Instead, (for non-blocking sockets) the OS may copy
as much of the memory range as it can fit in the network buffer and then lets
the caller know how much it copied via the return value.


```c
int socket;
char *buffer
size_t length;
ssize_t sent;

/* Preparing message */
…

/*Sending message */
sent = send(socket, buffer, length, 0);

assert( sent == length); //WRONG!
```

You should *not* assume that sent has the same value as length.  The function
`send` may need to be called again (with different parameters) to ensure that
the full message is sent.

Similarly, for `recv`, for TCP sockets, the OS does not wait for the range of
memory specified to be completely filled with data from the network before the
call returns.  Instead, only a portion of the originally sent data may be
delivered from the network to the memory address specified in a `recv`
operation.  The OS will let the caller know how much data it wrote via the
return value of the `recv` call.

In several ways, this behavior is desirable, not only from the perspective of
the operating system which must ensure that resources are properly shared, but
also from the user’s perspective.  For instance, the user may have no need to
store in memory all of the data to be transferred.  If the goal is to simply
save data received over the network to disk, then this can be done a chunk at a
time without having to store the whole file in memory.

In fact, it is this strategy that you should employ as the second part of the
warm-up.  You are to create a client, which simply connects to a server--no
message need be sent-- and saves the received data to a file on disk.

Beware of file permissions.  Make sure to give yourself read and write access,
e.g. `S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR` as the last parameter to open.

A sender of data may also want to use this approach of sending it a chunk at a
time to conserve memory.  Employ this strategy as you create a server that
simply begins transferring data from a file over the network once it
establishes a connection and closes the socket when finished.

You may consult the references suggested in this document or others on the
internet. Starter code is provided inside of the transfer directory.  Once you
have completed your programs inside this directory, you may submit it with the
command

Your server should not stop after a single transfer, but should continue accepting
and transferring files to other clients


```console
$ python submit.py transfer
```

## Part 1: Implementing the Getfile Protocol

Getfile is a simple protocol used to transfer a file from one computer to
another that we made up for this project.  A typical successful transfer is
illustrated below.

![Getfile Transfer Figure](illustrations/gftransfer.png)

The general form of a request is

```
<scheme> <method> <path>\r\n\r\n
```

Note:

* The scheme is always GETFILE.
* The method is always GET.
* The path must always start with a ‘/’.

The general form of a response is

```
<scheme> <status> <length>\r\n\r\n<content>
```

Note:

* The scheme is always GETFILE.
* The status must be in the set {‘OK’, ‘FILE_NOT_FOUND’, ‘ERROR’, 'INVALID'}.
* INVALID is the appropriate status when the header is invalid. This includes a malformed header as well an incomplete header due to communication issues.
* FILE_NOT_FOUND is the appropriate response whenever the client has made an
  error in his request.  ERROR is reserved for when the server is responsible
  for something bad happening.
* No content may be sent if the status is FILE_NOT_FOUND or ERROR.
* When the status is OK, the length should be a number expressed in ASCII (what
  sprintf will give you). The length parameter should be omitted for statuses
  of FILE_NOT_FOUND or ERROR.
* The sequence ‘\r\n\r\n’ marks the end of the header. All remaining bytes are
  the files contents.
* The space between the \<scheme> and the \<method> and the space between the \<method> and the \<path> are required. The space between the \<path> and '\r\n\r\n' is optional.
* The space between the \<scheme> and the \<status> and the space between the \<status> and the \<length> are required. The space between the \<length> and '\r\n\r\n' is optional.
* The length may be up to a 64 bit unsigned value (that is, the value will be less than 18446744073709551616) though we do not require that you support this amount (nor will we test against a 16EB-1 byte file).

### Instructions

For Part 1 of the assignment you will implement a Getfile client library and a
Getfile server library.  The API and the descriptions of the individual
functions can be found in the gfclient.h and gfserver.h header files.  Your
task is to implement these interfaces in the gfclient.c and gfserver.c files
respectively.  To help illustrate how the API is intended to be used and to
help you test your code we have provided the other files necessary to build a
simple Getfile server and workload generating client inside of the gflib
directory.  It contains the files

* Makefile - (do not modify) used for compiling the project components
* content.[ch] - (do not modify) a library that abstracts away the task of
  fetching content         from disk.
* content.txt - (modify to help test) a data file for the content library
* gfclient.c - (modify and submit) implementation of the gfclient interface.
* gfclient.h - (do not modify) header file for the gfclient library
* gfclient-student.h - (modify and submit) header file for students to modify - submitted for client only
* gfclient_download.c - (modify to help test) the main file for the client
  workload generator.  Illustrates use of gfclient library.
* gfserver.c - (modify and submit) implementation of the gfserver interface.
* gfserver.h - (do not modify) header file for the gfserver library.
* gfserver-student.h - (modify and submit) header file for students to modify - submitted for server only
* gfserver_main.c (modify to help test) the main file for the Getfile server.
  Illustrates the use of the gfserver library.
* gf-student.h (modify and submit) header file for students to modify - submitted for both client and server
* handler.o - contains an implementation of the handler callback that is
  registered with the gfserver library.
* workload.[ch] - (do not modify) a library used by workload generator
* workload.txt - (modify to help test) a data file indicating what paths should
  be requested and where the results should be stored.

### gfclient

The client-side interface documented in gfclient.h is inspired by [libcurl’s
“easy” interface](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-easy.html).  To help
illustrate how the API is intended to be used and to help you test your code,
we have provided the file gfclient_download.c. For those not familiar with
function pointers in C and callbacks, the interface can be confusing.  The key
idea is that before the user tells the gfclient library to perform a request,
he should register one function to be called on the header
(`gfc_set_headerfunc`) and register one function to be called for every “chunk”
of the body (`gfc_set_writefunc`). That is, one call to the latter function
will be made for every `recv()` call made by the gfclient library.  (It so
happens that none of the test code actually will use the header function, but
please implement your library to support it anyway.)

The user of the gfclient library may want his callback functions to have access
to data besides the information about the request provided by the gfclient
library.  For example, the write callback may need to know the file to which it
should write the data.  Thus, the user can register an argument that should be
passed to his callback on every call.  She or he does this with the
`gfc_set_headerarg` and `gfc_set_writearg` functions.  (Note that the user may
have multiple requests being performed at once so a global variable is not
suitable here.)

Note that the `gfcrequest_t` is used as an [opaque
pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer), meaning that it should
be defined within the gfclient.c file and no user code (e.g.
gfclient_download.c) should ever do anything with the object besides pass it to
functions in the gfclient library.

### gfserver

The server side interface documented in gfserver.h is inspired by python’s
built-in httpserver.  The existing code in the file gfserver_main.c illustrates
this usage.  Again, for those not familiar with function pointers in C and
callbacks, the interface can be confusing.  The key idea is before starting
up the server, the user registers a handler callback with gfserver library
which controls how the request will be handled.  The handler callback should
not contain any of the socket-level code.  Instead, it should use the
gfs_sendheader, gfs_send, and potentially the gfs_abort functions provided
by the gfserver library.  Naturally, the gfserver library needs to know which
request the handler is working on.  All of this information is captured in the
opaque pointer passed into the handler, which the handler must then pass back
to the gfserver library when making these calls.

### Submission

Read the documentation carefully for the requirements.  When you are ready to
turn in your code, use the command

```console
$ python submit.py gfclient
```

to turn in your gfclient.c file and

```console
$ python submit.py gfserver
```

to turn in your gfserver.c file.

## Part 2: Implementing a Multithreaded Getfile Server

*Note: For both the client and the server, your code should follow a
boss-worker thread pattern. This will be graded. Also keep in mind this is a multi-threading
exercise. You are **NOT** supposed to use `fork()` to spawn child processes, but instead
you should be using the **pthreads** library to create/manage threads. You will have
points removed if you don't follow this instruction.*

In Part 1, the Getfile server can only handle a single request at a time.  To
overcome this limitation, you will make your Getfile server multi-threaded by
implementing your own version of the handler in handler.c and updating gfserver_main.c
as needed.  The main, i.e. boss, thread will continue listening to the socket and
accepting new connection requests. New connections will, however, be fully handled by
worker threads. The pool of worker threads should be initialized to the number of
threads specified as a command line argument.  You may need to add additional
initialization or worker functions in handler.c.  Use extern keyword to make
functions from handler.c available to gfserver_main.c.  For instance, the main
file will need a way to set the number of threads.

Similarly on the client side, the Getfile workload generator can only download
a single file at a time.  In general for clients, when server latencies are
large, this is a major disadvantage.  You will make your client multithreaded
by modifying gfclient_download.c.  This will also make testing your getfile
server easier.

In the client, a pool of worker threads should be initialized based on number
of client worker threads specified with a command line argument. Once the
worker threads have been started, the boss should enqueue the specified
number of requests (from the command line argument) to them.  They should
continue to run.  Once the boss confirms all requests have been completed,
it should terminate the worker threads and exit.  We will be looking for
your code to use a work queue (from `steque.[ch]`), at least one
mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`), and at least one condition variable (`pthread_cond_t`)
to coordinate these activities. Bonnie will confirm that your implementation
meets these requirements.

The folder mtgf includes both source and object files The object
files gfclient.o and gfserver.o may be used in-place of your own
implementations.  Source code is not provided because these files implement
the protocol for Part 1.  Note: these are the binary files used by Bonnie.
They are known *not to work* on Ubuntu versions other than 18.04.  They are
64 bit binaries (only).  If you are working on other platforms, you should
be able to use your protocol implementation files from Part 1.

* Makefile - (do not modify) used for compiling the project components
* content.[ch] - (do not modify) a library that abstracts away the task of
  fetching content         from disk.
* content.txt - (modify to help test) a data file for the content library
* gfclient.o - (do not modify) implementation of the gfclient interface.
* gfclient.h - (do not modify) header file for the gfclient library
* gfclient-student.h - (modify and submit) header file for students to modify - submitted for client only
* gfclient_download.c - (modify and submit) the main file for the client
  workload generator.  Illustrates use of gfclient library.
* gfserver.o - (do not modify) implementation of the gfserver interface.
* gfserver.h - (do not modify) header file for the gfserver library.
* gfserver-student.h - (modify and submit) header file for students to modify - submitted for server only
* gfserver_main.c (modify and submit) the main file for the Getfile server.
  Illustrates the use of the gfserver library.
* gf-student.h (modify and submit) header file for students to modify - submitted for both client and server
* handler.c - (modify and submit) contains an implementation of the handler callback that is
  registered with the gfserver library.
* steque.[ch] - (do not modify) a library you must use for implementing your boss/worker queue.
* workload.[ch] - (do not modify) a library used by workload generator
* workload.txt - (modify to help test) a data file indicating what paths should
  be requested and where the results should be stored.

### Submission

Read the documentation carefully for the requirements.  When you are ready to
turn in your code, use the command

```console
$ python submit.py gfclient_mt
```

to turn in your gfclient_download.c file and

```console
$ python submit.py gfserver_mt
```

to turn in your handler.c and gfserver_main.c files.

## Readme

Throughout your development you should be keeping notes about what you are doing
for your development.  We encourage you to submit your readme file as your project
develops, so that it can serve as a log of your work.

This file can be either a markdown file (readme-student.md) or a PDF (readme-student.pdf).
The submit script will submit either (or both) but it raises an error if neither exists.

To obtain all possible points, we want you to demonstrate your understanding of what you
have done.  We are not looking for a diary, we are looking for a clear explanation of
what you did and why you did it.  This is your graders opportunity to award you points
for _understanding_ the project, even if you struggle with the implementation, as
these are manually graded.

Use the command:

```console
$ python submit.py readme
```

from the top directory (where your readme-student.md or readme-student.pdf is located).
The script will **only** submit files with those names - if you call your file `my-really-cool-readme.docx` _it will not be submitted_.  The script will upload one or
both files (`student-readme.{md,pdf}`) to Bonnie.  If both are present, we will use the
PDF version for grading.  If only one is present, we will grade that version.

**NOTE:** This is your opportunity to clearly document your reference materials.

Finally, we encourage you to make concrete suggestions on how you would improve this project. This is not _required_ for the project, but is an opportunity for you to earn extra credit points.  This could also include sample code, suggested tests
(we really like examples!), ways to improve the documentation, etc.

  -l`.
* In the warm-up part, the server should be running forever. It should not
  terminate after serving one request.
* Use the  class VM to test and debug your code. Udacity does basic tests and
  passing the tests does not guarantee a full score. You are mostly likely to
  get a good score though.
